Postmod

## Post-modern application development

Postmod is an experimental project trying to find a satisfying and easy way to create applications for the web and beyond. I've started working on it after many years of wishing Rails did not have the shortcomings explained in Uncle Bob's Architecture: The lost years (go see it if you haven't already), and looking for a more sustainable workflow than starting every new project from scratch.

## Quickstart
```
$ gem install postmod
$ postmod new helloworld
$ cd helloworld
$ bundle install
$ git init
$ git commit -am "App setup"
$ heroku apps:create helloworld # This app name is probably already taken, feel free to chose another one
$ git push --set-upstream heroku master
```

Done!
Check out the tutorials for how to build some basic apps.
